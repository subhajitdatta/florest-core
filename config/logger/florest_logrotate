# logrotate config for discovery logs
# needs logrotate version 3.8.7
# place this in /etc/logrotate.d/

# Best practice is to set the logrotate to run as an hourly cron with
# the below command:-
# /usr/sbin/logrotate /etc/logrotate.d/discovery_logrotate

# If App name is changed from discovery and the location of log
# is changed then change the below log name as well
/var/log/discovery/discovery-*.log {
	# su user group Rotate log files created by this user and group. This needs to be changed in
	# each environment. user and group have to be set to the user and its group who is generating the logs	
	su jade jade

	# Don't throw any errors or warning if there are no log files
	missingok

	# Don;t create any log file after rolling
	nocreate

	# Compress log file after creation
	compress

	# logrotate to be run hourly. This is not necessary since we are setting this up in hourly cron
	hourly

	# max file size after which to do log rotation
	maxsize 1G

	# max number of days for which rolled log files are to be kept
	maxage 28

	# max number of times a file is to be rotated.
	rotate 500
